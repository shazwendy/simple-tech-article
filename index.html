	<h1>6 WAYS TECHNOLOGY AFFECTS OUR LIVES DAILY</h1>

<br>We are living in an era of advanced technology, where every part of our daily lives is related to the science of craft in one way or another. There’s no doubt that over the years technology has been responsible for creating amazingly useful resources which put all the information we need at our fingertips. The development of technology has led to so many mind-blowing discoveries, better facilities, and better luxuries, but at the same has dramatically changed our daily lives. Various highly-developed gadgets, connected to the Internet, have changed the way we communicate, use humor, study, work, shop, play, and behave.</br>

<br>It’s not difficult to recognize just how much of the technology we use on a daily basis — from computers, cell phones, laptops, tablets and TVs to refrigerators and convection ovens that cook food evenly. Here are six ways technology impacts your daily life.</br>

<h1>1: Improved Communication</h1>
<br>The continuous advances in technology have led to the appearance of numerous new methods of electronic communication, such as social networking websites, emails, voicemails, and video conferences. These advanced communication tech tools have helped us to eliminate time and distance as obstacles to effective communication. This is beneficial not only to our personal relationships, but also to education and business. Technology has improved cultural education by giving children the opportunity to communicate with other children from different countries and learn about different cultures.</br>

<br>Even though technology is beneficial to communication and allows people to stay in touch, you need to find a balance between the cyber world and real world. These technological advancements might be incredible and important in today’s society, but you must be careful to not lose sight of the people who are physically around you. While communicating via social media might be fun and more convenient, it is also harmful to our social skills. Spending quality time with your friends and family to create memorable experiences is especially important for happiness.</br>

<h1>2: Improved Home Entertainment</h1>
<br>Not that long ago, our entertainment experiences used to live in the moment they happened, exist in our memories and find their way in old-fashioned photographs on wall. Today, that has all changed due to the rapid growth of the Internet, mobile connectivity, and social networks.</br>

<br>One of the biggest changes, for example, was the switch from videotapes to CDs/DVDs. This enabled manufacturers to put more data onto the medium. This meant that there were no risks of the tape coming out of the player and getting damaged that easily, and due to the small size of the DVDs, it also meant that a lot more could be stored in the same amount of space.</br>

<br>Another huge technological advance was the introduction of LCD TV. Compared to today’s LCD TVs, the previous television screens were inefficient, with lower definition and poor quality. Today we can not only enjoy improved home entertainment, but different types of home entertainment too: from smart TVs to Xbox units.</br>

<h1>3: Improved Housing and Lifestyle</h1>
<br>Housing and lifestyle have also been impacted by the modern technology. The majority of the items that you have in your home today are automated, which makes your life much easier, organized and safer. Thanks in particular to the advanced technological solutions such automated door locks, security cameras and lighting control, our homes are now more secure than ever. Also, thanks to the Internet, we have an easy access to all sorts of information, news, and you’re able to shop online any time of the day or night from the comfort of your own home.</br>

<h1>4: Changed Health Industry</h1>
<br>There’s no doubt that technology is the driving force behind the huge improvements in healthcare. The majority of the hospitals today have implemented modern technology in hospitals and surgical rooms, which has significantly reduced the mistakes made by doctors. The increased accessibility of treatment is also one of the most amazing ways that technology has changed health care. Besides the technological advancements in hospitals, there are also many health phone and desktop apps that allow you to easily monitor your weight, heart rate, and other health properties at any time of the day. Needless to say, the Internet is our main source of medical information.</br>

<br>A n increasing number of people are now using the Internet to diagnose themselves by looking for advice from people on the Internet who have experienced the same symptoms. There are also many suggested treatments and remedies on the web, as well as alternative solutions. Technology has also enabled doctors to use text messages, videos, and e-mails to consult colleagues from all over the world, which is especially beneficial to patients and doctors that live in rural and under-developed areas.</br>
